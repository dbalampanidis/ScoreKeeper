# ScoreKeeper

Simple score keeper app created with HTML and Javascript.
Begin by selecting a score to play up to and add points to each player by pressing the corresponding player button.

Added a "win by 2" logic so that so that players have to win with a 2 points difference.
e.g. If the Play Up to score is 3, getting a score of 2-2 will increase the winning score by 1. A player will now win if he gets a score of 4-2.
